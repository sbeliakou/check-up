cases:

- name: create file in '/tmp/new_folder' folder

- name: delete '/tmp/new_folder' folder
  script: rm -rf /tmp/new_folder

# this case should fail
- case: Validate that '/tmp/new_folder' dir exists
  script: test -d /tmp/new_folder

# but this one works fine
# before running this task checkup runs "before" tasks
# and after it finishes, it executes "after" tasks
- case: Validate that '/tmp/new_folder' dir exists
